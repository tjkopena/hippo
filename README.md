HippoCrypto wraps basic functions for cryptographic identities,
digital signatures, and encryption.

_Please remember that cryptography is complex!  There are many subtle
issues.  Although this API aims to make these functions easy to use,
you must still understand the implications and guarantees before doing
so.  Further, no warranties or guarantees of any kind, but most
especially security, are made or implied regarding this code._
